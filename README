Where are the passwords stored? Where are the salt strings
stored? Why do you send the plain text password/hashed password? Can someone
read the password in transit? What are the security implications of your decision?
-Since we didn't implement passwords, we are not logging any passwords.
and since we are sending everything through SSL the security should be fine

Should private messages be logged? If so, what should be logged about private messages? What are the consequences of your decisions?
-We think not, so nothing should be logged. The consequences are that the users feel safe using our chat since we are not logging their personal messages.

We are using certificates without passphrases since we assume the users are on their private computer.
